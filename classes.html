    <p><strong>KING OF THE JUNGLE</strong> introduces students to the different art forms we offer at Brooklyn Zoo. Students will be introduced to Parkour, trampolining, tumbling, tricking.</p>

    <p><strong>PARKOUR</strong> is an art, practice and discipline emphasizes efficient movement while flowing through obstacles with ease. Practitioners run, jump, vault and climb to find the best way of getting from point A to point B.</p>

    <p><strong>CAPOEIRA</strong> is an Afro-Brazilian art-form that combines martial arts, dance and music. Created by enslaved Africans in Brazil as a means of self-expression in the fight for freedom, Capoeira is now practiced throughout the world.</p>

    <p><strong>BREAKDANCING</strong> is a street style of dance that started in the â€˜80s with the emergence of hip hop music. The dance style consists of a mixture of movements, including beat rocking and floor acrobatics.</p>

    <p><strong>TRAMPOLINE</strong> lessons are great for all ages. We provide a safe, friendly environment where your child can learn trampoline skills and techniques safely from trained coaches.</p>

    <p><strong>TUMBLING</strong> is a form of gymnastics that primarily utilizes the spring floor. Our coaches teach our students to gain complete body control and awareness. Tumbling is ideal for keeping your body lean and strong.</p>

    <p><strong>TRICKING</strong> is an art form that combines intricate martial arts and acrobatic movements ranging from capoeira and wushu, to gymnastics and breakdancing. We offer beginner and intermediate classes.</p>

    <p><strong>NEW STYLE HUSTLE</strong> is a unique twist on the partner dance of the disco era-the hustle. It is an aesthetic that incorporates basic hustle coordinated patterns and footwork while encouraging freedom of movement, feeling and creativity.</p>

    <p><strong>CONTORTION AND EXTREME STRETCH</strong> is designed to straighten and extend one's body to become more flexible and agile.</p>

    <p><strong>YOGA</strong> we offer a vinyasa-style class that opens with meditation and breath work and then moves through a series of sun salutations, standing and seated poses, back bending, and inversions. Offering an opportunity to cultivate self-awareness and an overall sense of ease and joy.</p>

    <p><strong>AERIAL SILKS</strong> the beauty of the flowing material wrapping around the body is matched only by the breath-taking courage needed to be suspended several stories above the ground. It will build upper body strength, tone your core, and increase your flexibility. Aerial silks will push your boundaries both physically and mentally</p>
